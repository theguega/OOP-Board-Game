# **Splendor Duel**

## **Description**
This project is a digital implementation of the board game **Splendor Duel** (designed by Marc André and Bruno Cathala) developed using **C++** and **Qt** for the graphical interface. The project was created as part of the LO21 course at **UTC** (Université de Technologie de Compiègne).

Here’s a short video showcasing the project:

### **Project Setup**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
To compile the project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the `.pro` file with Qt.

#### **2. Adjust Build Settings**
- Go to the **'Projects'** section in Qt, then under **'Build & Run'**:
  - Uncheck **'Shadow build'** in the **'Build'** tab.
  - Set the working directory to the **source folder** (this ensures that relative paths work correctly).

#### **3. Compile and Run**
Once the settings are configured, you can proceed to compile and run the project within Qt.

#### **4. AI vs AI Mode**
For optimal performance, we recommend running the **AI vs AI mode** in an external terminal instead of within Qt, as the Qt terminal limits the speed of the outputs. For example, on a Mac, the AI vs AI mode finishes instantly in an external terminal, while it takes longer within Qt.

### **Compatibility**
The application has been tested on **Mac** and **Windows**, but it has **not been tested on Linux**. Some bugs may still exist, especially in the graphical mode, as it's difficult to track all issues during long games. However, in **console mode**, numerous AI vs AI games have been run without crashes since the last updates.
